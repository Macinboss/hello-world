# hello-world
This is my first time on Git Hub!

I'm joining GitHub to try and learn as much as possbile. I'm excited to be a part of such an amazing community! The picture here is of Enceladus 1 - the sixth-largest moon of Saturn! I'm currently living in ATX, and work for a computer company and am hoping to take my career to the next level with Python!
